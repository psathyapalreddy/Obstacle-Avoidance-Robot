# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot

#Problem Statement:
Road accident is a major issue in many countries, mostly fast-moving vehicles face collision on roads. Another issue is the uncontrollable condition that if a person gets sleepy during the driving it can also cause collisions with nearby objects. Obstacle detection and avoidance can be considered as the central issue in designing mobile robots.

#Proposed Solution:
In this project we purpose a obstacle avoiding car which can automatically sense the obstacle in its way and avoid it by changing the direction. It is a robot vehicle that works on Arduino microcontroller and employs ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles. On basis of sensor detection, the dc motor turns the wheel left or right and then moves forward according to the program which executing through Arduino software.

#Eqipment Needed:
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor,
SG-90 Servo motor,
Arduino Uno,
L298N Motor driver Shield,
DC motors,
Jumping wires,
Lithium-ion Battery(Cylindrical),
